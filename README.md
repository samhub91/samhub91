- ⚡ Fun fact: ... there is no final level when learning
- Building = Real Learning – You only truly understand something when you try to build with it. It’s called the Feynman Technique.
- Forgetting helps learning – It may sound weird, but forgetting some information and relearning it strengthens memory. That’s why spaced repetition works!
- Mistakes make you smarter – Making errors while building helps your brain adjust strategies and learn faster next time.
